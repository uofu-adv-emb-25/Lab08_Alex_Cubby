# Lab 09 - Can

## Activity 1
Initial results show successful transmission and receiving with one braodcast node and one receiving. Initial signal issues were solved by properly terminating the bus. 

## Activity 2 
Babbling node initally blocked all messages from lower priority. Introducing even a small delay (order of ms), allowed reliable receipt of intermittent transmissions from lower priority node.
